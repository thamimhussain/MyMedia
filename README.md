# MyMedia

Website to keep track of all the different types of media that I have consumed. 

Use SQLite as the database management system, Python for the backend (API calls and database interaction), HTML/CSS + Javascript/REACT for the frontend.
- Backend:
  - API Calls: Can do API calls to auto-find the media you are looking for (list of movies, shows, anime, manga, books, etc).
      - https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/s3pl16/i_made_an_anime_and_manga_search_application/ <---- info on AniList API
      - mangadex API for manga
      - open movie db api for movie/shows? or TMBD
  - SQL info to store: name of media, form of media (movie, show, etc), completed/watching/dropped, episodes watched, personal rating, optional review
- Frontend:
  - Very simple two page UI most likely
  - Page One:
    - Area where I can view every input as a list, with ability to sort based on each column
  - Page Two:
    - Area where you can add/delete an input and update any of the columns for any of the inputs

  Things to consider:
    - Maybe figure out how to add different users (unlikely)?
    - Deploy to the Cloud (whatever that means)?
    -
